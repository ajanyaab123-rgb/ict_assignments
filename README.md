# Assignment Solutions (Jupyter Notebooks)


## Description
This repository contains solutions to programming assignments implemented using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**. Each notebook addresses a separate problem statement and includes solutions to multiple sub-questions where applicable.

One of the assignments involves designing a **console-based Smart Library Circulation System**, focusing on book management, student registration, borrowing rules, and overdue handling in an offline environment.


## Repository Structure
- `Ajanya_A_B_Assignment1.ipynp` - Contains solutions to Assignment 1 
- `Ajanya_A_B_Assignment3.ipynp` — Contains solutions to Assignment 3
- `Ajanya_A_B_assignment2.ipynp` — Contains solutions to Assignment 2
- `Ajanya_A_B_project.ipynp` — Console-based Smart Library Circulation System implementation

## Smart Library Circulation System (Project Overview)
The Smart Library Circulation System is a menu-driven, console-based application designed for a college department library. The system supports:

- Book management (add, search, track availability)
- Student registration
- Book issuing and returning
- Enforcement of borrowing rules
- Overdue tracking and penalty calculation

### Key Features
- Issue books only if copies are available  
- Limit the number of books a student can borrow  
- Prevent issuing the same book twice to the same student  
- Calculate overdue penalties based on excess days  
- Partial string matching for book search  
- Display overdue reports  

The implementation uses appropriate Python data structures such as **dictionaries, lists, tuples, and strings**, with input validation and logical consistency enforced throughout.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajanyaab123-rgb/ict_assignments.git 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ict_assignments
3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
4.	Open any .ipynp file to view or execute the solutions.
  
## Notes
- These notebooks are intended for learning and academic reference purposes.
- The console-based system runs in an offline environment and continues execution until the user chooses to exit.
